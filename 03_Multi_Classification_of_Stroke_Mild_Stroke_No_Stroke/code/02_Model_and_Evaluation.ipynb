\n","<br>The context and rationales are detailed as follows:\n","\n","**Context:**<br>\n","In the case of **mild stroke** or its scientific term **'Transcient Ischemic Attack (TIA)'**, we hypothesise that surveyees who have experienced TIA are very likely to be in the wrongly classified data set (see below for detailed explanation):\n","\n","**False Negatives:** \n","1.

Or might apply to persons who actually experienced a TIA but our model classified as no stroke\n","    - **Interpretation:** Since the original survey questions did not distinguish between TIA and a full stroke, they could have answered 'yes' to stroke but experienced a TIA\n","\n","**False Positives:**\n","1. Might apply to persons who  actually never experienced a stroke but our model classified them as having had stroke before\n","    - **Interpretation:** This suggests that their attributes are more alike those who have experienced a stroke.\n","2. Or might apply to persons who actually never experienced a full stroke but experienced a TIA\n","    - **Interpretation:** As above, they might have answered 'no' to stroke as they did not perceive their TIA as a stroke.\n","\n","**Conclusion:**<br>\n","- Based on the above, we hypothesise that our wrongly classified data contains **3 clusters**: Stroke, No stroke, and Mild Stroke. \n","- We will proceed to test our hypothesis in the next notebook via **unsupervised classification algorithms** to create the 3 new classifications.\n","\n","**Next Step:**<br>\n","We will extract the wrongly classified data into a new dataframe to perform the unsupervised classification which will be covered in the next notebook."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h2>1.
