<h2 style="font-family: Segoe UI; color: #133DEE;">Projects</h2>

### 1. Capstone Project : Detecting Microsatellite Instability (MSI) in Colorectal Cancer Tissues

* **Overview:** Developed a deep learning model to identify colorectal cancer patients who might benefit from immunotherapy. The model would analyze histopathological image data (stained tissue slides) to classify tumors as microsatellite stable (MSS) or microsatellite instable (MSI). Detecting tumors with high MSI is important to determine if patients may benefit from immunotherapy. This project explored both custom CNN models and transfer learning with a pre-trained EfficientNetV2M model.
* **Key Skills:** Image data preprocessing, feature engineering, building convolutional neural networks, streamlit app building.

### 2. Singapore Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

* **Overview:** Developed a predictive model for Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale flat prices, utilizing a 2012-2021 dataset and advanced regression techniques. The model achieves an R2 score of 0.8728 and accurately predicts prices with an average error of S$50,900, empowering property buyers and sellers to make informed decisions.
* **Key Skills:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering and regression modeling.

### 3. Reddit Scams : Are We Vulnerable?

* **Overview:** Developed a natural language processing (NLP) model to assist Reddit moderators in identifying potential scams within posts. Leveraging data from r/RandomKindness and r/Scams, the model achieves a 97.5% accuracy & 96.4% sensitivity in classifying posts, providing a valuable tool to combat the increasing prevalence of online fraud.

* **Key Skills:** Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW), n-gram analysis, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, hyperparameter tuning.

### 4. Multi-Classification of Stroke, Mild Stroke, and No Stroke

* **Overview:** Utilized machine learning algorithms to capture mild stroke cases which are often overlooked. From a Kaggle dataset, we employed classification and clustering algorithms. While challenges arose in differentiating mild strokes due to data limitations, the project highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms in mild stroke detection.
* **Key Skills:** 
    * Handled imbalanced data, explored feature correlations, data transformations
    * Multiple algorithms: Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector, Gradient Boosting, KMeans, hierarchical clustering, DBScan
